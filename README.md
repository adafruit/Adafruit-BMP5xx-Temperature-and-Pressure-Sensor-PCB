### Description

Bosch has been a leader in barometric pressure sensors, from the BMP085. BMP180, BMP280, BMP388, BMP390... now we've got the next generation, the Adafruit BMP585 Precision Barometric Pressure and Altimeter Breakout. As you would expect, this sensor is similar to its earlier versions but even better. The BMP585 has better precision than ever, which makes it excellent for environmental sensing or as a precision altimeter. It can even be used in either I2C and SPI configurations.

The BMP5xx is the next-generation of sensors from Bosch and is the upgrade to the BMP2xx and BMP3xx - with a low-altitude noise as low as 1cm (0.08Pa) and the same fast conversion time. And like the previous BMP280, you can use I2C or SPI. For simple easy wiring, go with I2C. If you want to connect a bunch of sensors without worrying about I2C address collisions, go with SPI.

The BMP585 and BMP580 has a relative accuracy of ±6 Pascals at room temperature, which translates to about ±50 centimeters of altitude (compare to the BMP280's ±12 Pascal/±1 meter and BMP388's ±8 Pascal/±0.5 meter). The typical absolute accuracy is ±60 Pa or about 5 meters. Check the datasheet for how temperature and altitude can affect the absolute/relative accuracy.

The BMP581 has an astonishing relative accuracy of ±0.4 Pascals at 900-1100 hPa and 25°C, which translates to about ±3.3 centimeters of altitude (compare to the BMP280's ±12 Pascal/±1 meter and BMP388's ±8 Pascal/±0.5 meter). The typical absolute accuracy is ±30Pa or about 2.5 meters. Check the datasheet for how temperature and altitude can affect the absolute/relative accuracy.

The datasheet sort of implies they intend this sensor to be used for drones and quadcopters, to keep altitude stable, but you could also use this for wearables or any project that wants to track height-above-sea-level. Note that for absolute height you'll still need to enter in the barometric pressure at sea level if the weather changes, but that's true of every altimeter sensor that uses pressure. You can also measure temperature with ±0.5°C accuracy.

Nice sensor right? So we made it easy for you to get right into your next project. The surface-mount sensor is soldered onto a custom made PCB in the STEMMA QT form factor, making them easy to interface with. The STEMMA QT connectors on either side are compatible with the SparkFun Qwiic I2C connectors. This allows you to make solderless connections between your development board and the BMP58x or to chain it with a wide range of other sensors and accessories using a compatible cable. QT Cable is not included, but we have a variety in the shop
